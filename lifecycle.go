package pool

// lifecycleSink is the narrow storage capability required by the lifecycle
// layer in order to complete the return path of a reusable value.
//
// # Why this interface exists
//
// The public pool runtime has two fundamentally different responsibilities:
//
//  1. lifecycle policy — deciding whether a value may be reused, resetting it,
//     and observing rejected values;
//  2. storage backend interaction — physically storing an already accepted,
//     already reset value for future reuse.
//
// These concerns should not be collapsed into one monolithic implementation
// block. The lifecycle layer should only depend on the minimal capability it
// needs from the backend: the ability to accept a value that is already ready
// to be stored.
//
// Keeping the sink contract this small has several benefits:
//
//   - lifecycle code remains independent of [sync.Pool]-specific details;
//   - the public runtime can be structured as policy above, backend below;
//   - alternate internal backends or debug wrappers can be introduced without
//     rewriting lifecycle semantics;
//   - the canonical order of operations for Put stays centralized in one place.
//
// This interface is intentionally unexported. It is an internal assembly point
// for the package runtime, not a public extension mechanism.
//
// # Contract
//
// Implementations MUST treat Put as the final storage step for a value that has
// already been accepted for reuse and fully reset. In particular, implementations
// of lifecycleSink MUST NOT assume responsibility for:
//
//   - deciding whether the value should be reused;
//   - resetting the value;
//   - invoking drop callbacks;
//   - tracking logical ownership.
//
// Those responsibilities belong to the lifecycle controller defined in this
// file and to the public pool runtime that uses it.
//
// In the current architecture, the primary implementation is
// internal/backend.SyncPool[T].
type lifecycleSink[T any] interface {
	Put(T)
}

// lifecycle encapsulates the canonical return-path semantics for values managed
// by a typed Pool.
//
// # Scope
//
// This type exists to own the semantics of what happens when a caller returns a
// temporary reusable value. It is deliberately separate from both:
//
//   - public configuration ([Options]), which describes policy declaratively;
//   - backend storage ([lifecycleSink]), which stores values mechanically.
//
// The purpose of lifecycle is therefore not to be a second public abstraction,
// but to serve as the internal semantic engine of the package runtime.
//
// # Canonical return path
//
// For a value v returned by a caller, lifecycle follows this strict order:
//
//  1. evaluate the reuse admission policy;
//  2. if reuse is denied, invoke the drop callback and stop;
//  3. if reuse is allowed, reset the value into a clean reusable state;
//  4. pass the clean value to the backend sink for storage.
//
// That order is intentional and should remain stable.
//
// # Why admission happens before reset
//
// Reuse admission is evaluated before reset so that the package can decide
// whether a value should be retained based on the state it actually accumulated
// while in use. Typical examples include:
//
//   - a temporary object whose internal slice grew beyond an acceptable bound;
//   - an instance that entered a poisoned or non-reusable state;
//   - a scratch structure whose retained memory would be too expensive to keep.
//
// If reset were performed first, policy code would lose visibility into that
// state and could no longer make accurate retention decisions.
//
// # Why reset happens before backend storage
//
// Reset is applied before the value re-enters backend storage so that:
//
//   - retained values remain in a clean state while idle in the backend;
//   - references are dropped as early as possible;
//   - the acquisition path stays lean and predictable;
//   - callers of Pool.Get observe values that are already safe to use.
//
// # Non-goals
//
// lifecycle intentionally does not:
//
//   - track ownership or detect double Put operations;
//   - recover from misuse or invalid application-level object state;
//   - coordinate between goroutines;
//   - provide validation-on-borrow or validation-on-return hooks;
//   - decide how values are physically stored or reclaimed by the backend.
//
// Those concerns either belong to application code, future debug-only tooling,
// or the backend itself.
//
// # Stability
//
// The project is intended to change conservatively after stabilization. For
// that reason, this type is deliberately narrow and explicit. The lifecycle
// semantics embodied here should be treated as part of the package's core
// internal contract.
type lifecycle[T any] struct {
	reset  ResetFunc[T]
	reuse  ReuseFunc[T]
	onDrop DropFunc[T]
}

// newLifecycle constructs the internal lifecycle controller from already
// resolved options.
//
// resolvedOptions guarantees that all policy hooks are non-nil. This means the
// lifecycle controller can execute its hot path logic without repeatedly
// checking for missing callbacks.
//
// The constructor does not perform additional validation because validation and
// defaulting belong in [Options.resolve]. By the time execution reaches this
// layer, policy should already be normalized and immutable.
//
// This separation is intentional:
//
//   - Options.resolve owns configuration correctness;
//   - newLifecycle owns semantic assembly;
//   - the public Pool runtime owns orchestration.
func newLifecycle[T any](resolved resolvedOptions[T]) lifecycle[T] {
	return lifecycle[T]{
		reset:  resolved.resetFn,
		reuse:  resolved.reuseFn,
		onDrop: resolved.dropFn,

}

// AllowReuse reports whether the value is eligible to be retained for future
// reuse.
//
// This method is a thin semantic wrapper over the configured [ReuseFunc]. It is
// intentionally kept separate from Reset and Release so that the runtime can,
// when necessary, reason about admission as an explicit step rather than a
// hidden side effect.
//
// In the normal public runtime, callers will most often use [lifecycle.Release]
// instead of invoking AllowReuse directly. The method exists because making the
// individual steps addressable keeps the lifecycle model readable and testable.
//
// AllowReuse must be free of side effects beyond whatever the configured policy
// itself performs. The package expects the configured [ReuseFunc] to behave as
// a read-only admission decision.
func (l lifecycle[T]) AllowReuse(value T) bool {
	return l.reuse(value)
}

// ResetForReuse prepares a value for backend storage after admission has
// already succeeded.
//
// The method intentionally does not perform a reuse check. Callers must only
// invoke it after deciding that the value should be retained.
//
// Separating admission and reset clarifies the lifecycle model and avoids
// conflating two different concerns:
//
//   - admission answers "should this value be kept?";
//   - reset answers "how should this value be cleaned before storage?".
//
// In the default runtime, this method is primarily exercised through
// [lifecycle.Release]. It remains separately exposed to package-internal code so
// that tests, alternate runtime assemblies, or debug paths can drive the steps
// explicitly if needed.
func (l lifecycle[T]) ResetForReuse(value T) {
	l.reset(value)
}

// ObserveDrop handles a value that was explicitly rejected for reuse.
//
// ObserveDrop does not attempt to reset or retain the value. Its only role is
// to run the configured [DropFunc], if any, so that low-cost best-effort
// observation can take place.
//
// The method intentionally does not guarantee that every ultimately discarded
// object in the system will pass through this code path. Once a value has been
// accepted into a [sync.Pool]-style backend, that backend may later release it
// without further callbacks. ObserveDrop therefore represents explicit
// rejection-by-policy, not a universal finalizer mechanism.
func (l lifecycle[T]) ObserveDrop(value T) {
	l.onDrop(value)
}

// Release executes the canonical return path for a value and, if admitted,
// stores it in the provided backend sink.
//
// # Behaviour
//
// Release performs the following steps in order:
//
//  1. evaluate the reuse policy via [lifecycle.AllowReuse];
//  2. if reuse is denied, invoke [lifecycle.ObserveDrop] and return;
//  3. reset the value via [lifecycle.ResetForReuse];
//  4. forward the clean value to the backend sink.
//
// This method is intended to be the normal implementation of Pool.Put in the
// public runtime.
//
// # Ownership
//
// Callers must treat the value as no longer owned after Release returns,
// regardless of whether the value was stored or dropped. Release represents the
// end of the caller's lifecycle responsibility for the current borrowed value.
//
// # Sink requirements
//
// sink must not be nil. A nil sink indicates an internal programming error in
// the package runtime assembly and results in panic.
//
// # Panics
//
// Release panics if sink is nil. This is treated as a hard internal invariant
// violation because the lifecycle layer cannot complete its contract without a
// valid storage destination.
//
// Example conceptual flow:
//
//	value := p.backend.Get()
//	... caller uses value ...
//	p.lifecycle.Release(p.backend, value)
//
// The actual public Pool implementation may structure its code differently, but
// the semantic order of operations should remain identical.
func (l lifecycle[T]) Release(sink lifecycleSink[T], value T) {
	if sink == nil {
		panic("pool: nil lifecycle sink")
	}

	if !l.AllowReuse(value) {
		l.ObserveDrop(value)
		return
	}

	l.ResetForReuse(value)
	sink.Put(value)

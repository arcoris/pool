## Package overview

`arcoris.dev/pool` is a small, policy-driven Go package for typed reuse of
temporary mutable values. The package keeps the runtime surface narrow, makes
ownership transfer explicit, and preserves a fixed return-path order for reuse
admission, drop observation, reset, and storage.

Use this page as the repository-facing map. Use the
[package contract (`doc.go`)](../doc.go) as the Go-facing package contract.

## Source of truth

- [`../doc.go`](../doc.go) defines the package-facing contract and public model.
- [`./lifecycle.md`](./lifecycle.md) defines the normative lifecycle and ownership rules.
- [`./non-goals.md`](./non-goals.md) defines product scope boundaries and proposal limits.
- [`./architecture.md`](./architecture.md) explains repository structure and dependency direction.
- [`./performance/README.md`](./performance/README.md) is the navigation root for benchmark evidence.

| [Repository root](../) | public package code, tests, and benchmarks |
| [Internal backend directory](../internal/backend/) | storage implementation behind the public runtime |
| [Test utilities directory](../internal/testutil/) | shared helpers for tests and benchmarks |
| [Documentation directory](./) | repository-facing documentation set |
| [Benchmark scripts directory](../bench/scripts/) | benchmark collection, comparison, profiling, and plotting automation |
| [Charts directory](../bench/charts/) | generated SVG charts used by reports and README surfaces |

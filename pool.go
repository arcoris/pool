package pool

import "arcoris.dev/pool/internal/backend"

// Pool provides typed reuse of temporary values.
//
// Pool is the primary public runtime type of this package. It combines three
// internal responsibilities into one externally simple API:
//
//  1. value construction on the slow path, via [Options.New];
//  2. lifecycle policy on return, via [Options.Reset], [Options.Reuse], and
//     [Options.OnDrop];
//  3. low-level storage and retrieval, via an internal [sync.Pool]-backed
//     backend.
//
// In practical terms, Pool exists so that callers can work with the following
// extremely small surface:
//
//	v := p.Get()
//	... use v as a temporary object ...
//	p.Put(v)
//
// without having to manually repeat reset, reuse admission, and backend
// interaction logic throughout the codebase.
//
// # Intended use
//
// Pool is intended for temporary reusable values that are frequently created,
// mutated within a single logical operation, and then returned for possible
// reuse. Typical examples include:
//
//   - parser or decoder state objects;
//   - request-scoped scratch structures;
//   - reusable builders, envelopes, or temporary frames;
//   - short-lived mutable helper structs used on hot paths.
//
// Pool is usually not a good fit for:
//
//   - long-lived domain entities whose ownership escapes the current operation;
//   - values that must remain reachable after Put returns;
//   - objects requiring stable inventory guarantees or bounded-capacity borrow
//     semantics;
//   - lifecycle models that need validation-on-borrow, idle eviction,
//     reference counting, or blocking acquisition.
//
// # Design model
//
// Pool deliberately follows the temporary-object model of [sync.Pool] rather than
// the richer semantics of a full object-lifecycle manager. In particular:
//
//   - objects returned to the pool may later disappear from the backend without
//     notice;
//   - the pool does not promise stable retention of previously returned values;
//   - the pool does not track borrow state or detect double Put misuse;
//   - the pool does not impose a mandatory interface on T.
//
// The package instead keeps lifecycle policy explicit through [Options]. This
// allows the same type to be pooled under different reuse rules without forcing
// that type to embed reuse semantics directly into its own definition.
//
// # Ownership
//
// The caller owns a value obtained from [Pool.Get] until that value is passed
// to [Pool.Put]. After Put returns, the caller MUST treat the value as no
// longer owned. It must not be used, mutated, shared, or published as if it
// still belonged to the caller.
//
// Pool does not attempt to enforce this rule at runtime in the default build.
// Correct ownership remains the responsibility of the caller.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// Pool is safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines. Backend storage is
// delegated to [sync.Pool] through an internal adapter, and lifecycle policy is
// immutable after construction.
//
// What is and is not concurrency-safe:
//
//   - concurrent calls to Get and Put on the same *Pool are supported;
//   - the value returned by Get belongs to one logical owner until Put;
//   - a borrowed value must not be concurrently mutated unless the value type T
//     provides its own synchronization.
//
// # Zero value
//
// The zero value of Pool is not ready for use. Construct a pool with [New].
// This is intentional because a valid pool requires a construction policy and a
// backend assembled from that policy.
//
// # Copying
//
// Pool values should be treated as configuration-bearing runtime handles and
// used through *Pool. New returns *Pool for this reason.
//
// Although Pool mostly contains immutable policy references after construction,
// callers SHOULD NOT copy Pool values around by value. Doing so provides no
// benefit and obscures ownership of the runtime handle.
//
// # Performance notes
//
// The package is optimized for clarity of lifecycle and stable hot path shape,
// not for exotic specialization. The fast path of Pool.Get is a backend get.
// The fast path of Pool.Put is:
//
//  1. evaluate reuse policy;
//  2. optionally observe drop and return;
//  3. reset accepted value;
//  4. store accepted value.
//
// There are no repeated nil-hook checks on the hot path because [Options] are
// resolved once during construction.
//
// T may be any type, but pointer-like temporary values are usually the best
// fit. They avoid copying large mutable state and align with the intended use
// of pooling in Go.
//
// Example
//
//	type ParserState struct {
//		Input  []byte
//		Offset int
//		Tokens []Token
//		Err    error
//	}
//
//	states := pool.New(pool.Options[*ParserState]{
//		New: func() *ParserState {
//			return &ParserState{
//				Tokens: make([]Token, 0, 64),
//			}
//		},
//		Reset: func(s *ParserState) {
//			s.Input = nil
//			s.Offset = 0
//			s.Tokens = s.Tokens[:0]
//			s.Err = nil
//		},
//		Reuse: func(s *ParserState) bool {
//			return cap(s.Tokens) <= 4_096
//		},
//	})
//
//	state := states.Get()
//	defer states.Put(state)
//
//	// use state within the current operation only
//
// # Internal structure
//
// Pool intentionally keeps its internal structure simple:
//
//   - backend owns only storage and retrieval;
//   - lifecycle owns only return-path semantics;
//   - Pool itself owns public orchestration.
//
// This separation keeps the public runtime readable while still allowing the
// project to evolve internal implementation details conservatively.
//
// The type is expected to change rarely once stabilized. As a result, comments
// in this file are intentionally explicit and normative.
type Pool[T any] struct {
	backend   *backend.SyncPool[T]
	lifecycle lifecycle[T]
}

// New constructs a typed Pool from the supplied lifecycle policy.
//
// New is the only supported constructor for Pool. It validates and resolves the
// public [Options] value, assembles the internal lifecycle controller, and
// creates the internal [sync.Pool]-backed backend.
//
// # Construction steps
//
// New performs the following work in order:
//
//  1. validate and normalize [Options] via Options.resolve;
//  2. construct the internal backend using the resolved New policy;
//  3. construct the lifecycle controller using the resolved reset/reuse/drop
//     policies;
//  4. return the assembled *Pool.
//
// Because optional hooks are normalized during construction, the returned Pool
// does not need to perform nil checks for Reset, Reuse, or OnDrop on every Put.
//
// # Panics
//
// New panics if [Options.New] is nil. This is a construction-time contract
// violation because the pool cannot materialize a value when the backend is
// empty without a creation policy.
//
// New may also panic if the internal backend constructor contract is violated,
// though under normal use that cannot happen independently of options
// validation because the same resolved constructor is forwarded to the backend.
//
// Example
//
//	p := pool.New(pool.Options[*Builder]{
//		New: func() *Builder {
//			return &Builder{}
//		},
//		Reset: func(b *Builder) {
//			b.Reset()
//		},
//	})
//
// The returned pool is ready for concurrent Get/Put use immediately.
func New[T any](options Options[T]) *Pool[T] {
	resolved := options.resolve()

	return &Pool[T]{
		backend:   backend.NewSyncPool(resolved.newFn),
		lifecycle: newLifecycle(resolved),
	}
}

// Get returns a temporary reusable value of type T.
//
// # Behaviour
//
// Get asks the internal backend for a previously returned reusable value. If no
// such value is currently available, the backend constructs one using the
// resolved [NewFunc] captured when the pool was created.
//
// Get performs no lifecycle work beyond acquisition. In particular, Get does
// not:
//
//   - reset the value;
//   - validate that the value should still exist in the backend;
//   - decide whether the value should later be kept;
//   - attach ownership tracking metadata.
//
// The value returned by Get is logically owned by the caller until Put is
// called.
//
// # State guarantees
//
// A value returned by Get is either:
//
//   - a newly constructed value produced by [Options.New]; or
//   - a previously returned value that was accepted for reuse and reset before
//     being stored back into the backend.
//
// In both cases, callers should reason about the value as ready for immediate
// use according to the invariants defined by their construction and reset
// policies.
//
// # Panics
//
// Get panics if called on a nil *Pool. This is treated as a hard misuse of the
// public runtime handle.
//
// Example
//
//	v := p.Get()
//	// mutate v within the current operation
//	p.Put(v)
func (p *Pool[T]) Get() T {
	if p == nil {
		panic("pool: Get called on nil Pool")
	}

	return p.backend.Get()
}

// Put returns a value to the pool according to the configured lifecycle policy.
//
// # Canonical return path
//
// Put is the public entry point for the package's return-path semantics. It
// delegates the detailed order of operations to the internal lifecycle
// controller, which performs the following steps:
//
//  1. evaluate the configured [ReuseFunc];
//  2. if reuse is denied, invoke [DropFunc] and stop;
//  3. if reuse is allowed, invoke [ResetFunc];
//  4. store the cleaned value in the backend for possible future reuse.
//
// This order is intentional and should not be changed casually. In particular,
// reuse admission happens before reset so that the admission policy can inspect
// the value in the state it actually accumulated during use.
//
// # Ownership
//
// After Put returns, the caller MUST treat the value as no longer owned,
// regardless of whether the value was retained or dropped. Put represents the
// end of the caller's lifecycle responsibility for that borrowed value.
//
// # What Put does not do
//
// Put does not:
//
//   - guarantee that the value will be retained indefinitely;
//   - detect double Put misuse in the default runtime;
//   - provide destruction/finalization semantics for dropped or later-evicted
//     values;
//   - make the value safe for post-Put inspection by the caller.
//
// # Panics
//
// Put panics if called on a nil *Pool. This is treated as misuse of the public
// runtime handle.
//
// Example
//
//	state := p.Get()
//	defer p.Put(state)
//
//	// use state during the current operation only
func (p *Pool[T]) Put(value T) {
	if p == nil {
		panic("pool: Put called on nil Pool")
	}

	p.lifecycle.Release(p.backend, value)
}
